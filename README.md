# Project Assignment: Building an Agentic AI Assistant with LangChain and External Tools/APIs

## 1. High-Level Goal
Design and implement an AI assistant using LangChain that can autonomously decide which
tools/APIs to call and in what order to solve a user’s query.
The assistant must:
● Use LangChain’s agent/agentic flow (e.g., tool calling + reasoning loop).
● Integrate either:
○ At least 3 tools (e.g., search, calculator, local file reader, database query, etc.),
or
○ At least 2 external APIs wrapped as tools (e.g., weather API, news API,
flight/hotel API, GitHub API, etc.).
● Handle multi-step tasks where the agent:
○ Plans,
○ Calls tools,
○ Uses intermediate results to decide next steps,
○ And returns a final, well-structured answer to the user.

## 2. Example Use-Case Scenario (Propose Your Own)
You must choose one primary use case, and design the agent around it.
For Example: “Travel Planning Agent”
An agent that helps a user plan a short trip. For example:
● Inputs: destination city, travel dates, budget, preferences (e.g., museums, food, nightlife).
● The agent should:
○ Fetch real-time or recent information using APIs/tools (e.g., weather forecast
for those dates, places to visit, approximate hotel prices).
○ Possibly estimate a simple cost breakdown (using a calculator tool).
○ Output: Day-by-day itinerary and brief justification for each recommendation.

## Tools / APIs examples:
● Weather API as a tool
● Places/attractions API (e.g., maps/places) as a tool
● Calculator or custom “budget helper” tool
● (Optional) A local JSON/CSV file with typical costs per city as a data tool

1. User Experience
○ Interact through a simple CLI or minimal web interface (e.g., a CLI prompt loop
or a simple Gradio/Streamlit app).
○ Show, in the logs or interface, the sequence of tool calls and reasoning steps at
a high level (you can log tool names and their outputs).

## 3. Deliverables
1. GitHub Repo with User ****Guide
○ How to install dependencies.
○ How to run the agent.
○ Example commands/prompts the user can try.
○ Any API keys or configuration needed (without exposing your actual keys).
2. Demo
○ Short demo (recorded video) showing:
■ User query,
■ Tool sequence (can
